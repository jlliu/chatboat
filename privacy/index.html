		<h1>Privacy guaranteed during the wildest experience of your life.</h1>
		<h2>Required Chatboat Masks</h2>
		<img src="../mask.png">
		<p>We've design state-of-the-art AR (Alternate Reality) Masks to keep your experience as private as possible, while maximizing pleasure.</p>
		<h3>How it works</h3>
		<p>We mandate that all cruise patrons wear masks in all general spaces during their time on their stay in order to respect all of our guests' privacy.
		<p>To make sure this rule remains followed, we've designed our Masks with advanced RFID technology, which only allows them to be removed once guests enter their private living accomodations.</p>
		<p>When exiting living quarters, guests must wear and secure their mask in order to open their door and join the public spaces.
		<h3>Pleasure in a whole new dimension</h3>
		<p>Privacy isn't the only thing the Mask is good for. We've implemented advanced computer vision systems and AR graphics in order to make Pleasure Cell experiences even more life-like. With the Mask, the ultimate fantasy is just a sensual combination of visual and audio signals away.</p>
